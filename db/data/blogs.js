    article: 'How often should you water succulents? Succulents are lovely and don\'t require much watering. Stick your finger into the dirt to see if your plant is thirsty. If it feels dry at all, it\'s time to water! Succulents can thrive in a number of settings! <p>If your husband has trouble keeping plants alive, consider getting him one for his office!</p><p>Succulents come in a wide range of colors, forms, sizes, textures, and types, so there\'s something to suit everyone\'s taste or style.</p><p>They\'re also low maintenance, so no watering every day! They\'re practically the ideal houseplant!</p><p>Plant one this weekend and you\'ll have a new, stress-free buddy in no time. Let\'s see what happens. Succulents should be watered on a regular basis.</p><h2><strong>How do you Determine if the Soil is Completely Dry?</strong></h2><p>For the most part, determining if the soil of a succulent is fully dry is a piece of cake. Below, we\'ll go through two methods for determining the amount of moisture in a succulent.</p><p>One method, is to remove the succulent from its pot. Touch the bottom of the exposed dirt. If the soil is completely dry, it is time to water. If you detect any moisture in the soil, the plant does not need water yet.</p><p>A toothpick can also be used to see if your succulent needs to be watered. The toothpick approach is best suited for dish gardens or succulents with soil that is covered by pebbles or moss. Insert the toothpick all the way to the bottom of the succulent\'s soil. Remove the toothpick; if there is any moisture on the toothpick, wait to water the succulent.</p><h2><strong>Additional Note Regarding Drainage Holes</strong></h2><p>It is critical to observe whether the pot of your succulent has drainage holes while watering your succulents and establishing how often you should water a succulent. A <a href="https://gardeningmentor.com/what-size-drainage-holes-in-planters/">drainage hole</a> is either a single large hole or a series of little holes positioned at the bottom of your succulent pot.</p>',

    article: 'This fun holiday project combines two of my favorite things: living Christmas trees and succulents. There is a whole lot to love about both. For starters, living Christmas trees are better for the environment, and succulents are super forgiving plants, perfect for those who tend to kill every green thing they touch. What you may end up with is a lovely miniature succulent Christmas “tree” that will thrive all year round with very little care required. <h2>How to Make a Succulent Christmas Tree</h2> Things You Will Need: Chicken wire, Long nose pliers with cutter, Protective work gloves, Sphagnum moss, pre-moistened, Assorted succulent cuttings of various species/sizes, Floral greening pins, Pot with drainage holes (weighted with stones or another heavy material) and saucer, Mini Christmas tree ornaments (optional). Step 1: Make a Chicken Wire Topiary Cone Form. If you’ve never worked with chicken wire before, it may take some practice to shape it to your liking. (If you don’t want to go through this step, see the tip below.) Put on gloves to protect your hands from the severed wires, then cut out a symmetrical triangle whose size depend on how tall and broad you want your tree to be. My triangle has a bottom width of 16 inches and a point 14 inches from the base. Of course, as you may recall from geometry class, a 2D triangle linked edge to edge does not make a 3D symmetrical cone; instead, a disc with a wedge cut out (like in Pac-man) does. But making a Pac-Man out of chicken wire is a lot more labor! Instead, I overlapping the edges of my triangle and shaped the cone to achieve the desired symmetrical shape. Step 2: Pack Your Chicken Wire Form With Moss. Take your moistened sphagnum moss and stuff it tightly into your cone. Your succulent clippings should thrive in this medium. Make sure to purchase the long-fibered kind. Step 3: Put Tree Form Into Your Pot. Insert your shape into your pot, which is now weighted down with stones (or some other material that will give your base stability). When you water your tree, the stones will also aid ensure that the moss drains properly. Choose a pot that is slightly smaller in circle than your cone, so that it fits snugly. Step 4: Insert Succulent Cuttings Into Form.',

    article: 'Houseplants have a unique challenge that most outdoor plants don’t have: their roots are confined to a pot. When they start to overgrow the tight space, or when the foliage gets so heavy that they begin to tip over, it may be time to give them more room. Wondering how to repot? The main rules are to size up slowly and give the plant proper soil. Usually, a pot 1-2 inches larger in diameter is a good choice. A pot that is too big will make proper watering a challenge. Early spring and late fall are both ideal times for repotting',
